## Negative questions
They include a negative auxilary. These are usually fairly loaded (the speaker assumes the answer) and can be used to check understanding of something you already believe.

_**Don't** we start with the five questions?_
or to try and elicit agreement:
_****_

## Surprise
Statement + question word to show the surprise
_We go **where**?_
_You call it **what**?_

## Confirm questions
You mean/ So you're saying + statement to check or confirm information or to show understanding
_So **you mean** with this data we can present our findings to the board?_
_**So you're saying** we don't need to leave yet?_

## Indirect questions
Often used with questions which are difficult to ask, or to sound more polite.
_Could it be argued that it's a waste of time and money?_
_Would it be ridiculous if we refused to go?_

## Question tags
To confirm or check information
_**You don't mean** in the current climate though, **do you**?_
_**You're going** to talk to us about brainstorming today **aren't you**?_

## Not common question tags
_**Let's** think about the first issues, **shall we**?_
_**Everybody/everyone** likes chips, **don't they**?_

## How to add emphasis
Question word + _is it_ (cleft questions)
_What **is it** that you're trying to do?_
_**What exactly is** that makes them so loyal?_
