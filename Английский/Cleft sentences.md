## Usage
Cleft sentences are used to connect what the speaker and listener already know or are already discussing to what is new information.

## Types
- **It-clause** - emphasing new information and linking it with what is already known.
	Example: 
	A: Everyone is suffering financially these days.
	B: Yes, but **it's** the unemployed who are the worst off.
	(Мы уже знаем о финансовых проблемах и дополняем это информацией о безработице)
- **What-clause** - reference to known, given information and adding new details
	Example: What I'm saying is that it's important to plan ahead.
	(Мы уже говорили о своём мнении, но добавляем то, что не было упомянуто)

## Details
- When we substitute the main verb with ***did***, we use a ***to*** infinitive. 
	Example: What we ***did*** was ***to set up*** an investigation.
- If the main verb is followed by a gerund, then in the cleft is also followed by a gerund.
	Example: What I ***hate*** is ***being*** ignored.
- We can also follow the what-clause with a noun
	Example: What I don't like is ***disorganisation***.
- We can replace ***what*** with ***all*** to emphasise one thing above everything else.
	Example: ***All*** we want is cheaper homes.
