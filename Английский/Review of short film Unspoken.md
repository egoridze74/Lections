Gray and sad autumn evening is the best time to watch a heartwarming film about relationships which, at first glance, seems a short film "Unspoken" written and shoot by Tom and Shelley Ruddock in 2015.

The main characters of the film are a Man and a Woman, who once ran into each other and realised that they are neighbours. After the unfortunate meeting, they start to message each other with paper notes, exchanging sweet and lovely words. This plot seems to be very cute and romantic, but after thinking about their actions, you come to undestanding that the Man and the Woman are extremelly shy and unrealistic because their behavior is more childlike. With these thoughts you start to criticizing and searching faults with the film.

Despite all the plot and perception problems, every viewer would say that filmmakers know their job. Tom and Shelley Ruddock found a great musical accompaniment and really good shots and angles, so you are very interested and immersed with the film events. It is also noticeable that the actors are super-organic with their roles, therefore sometimes you can take this film for a documentary.

"Unspoken", with all the positive and negative aspects, is solid and pleasant film to watch if you have nothing to do.
