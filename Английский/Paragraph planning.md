## Main rule
**The cardinal rule of paragraphing – one paragraph, one idea.**

## Structure
### Topic sentence
This sentence is usually the first in a paragraph and it will present the main idea in general or vague terms.

It should not contain any specific information, and rather than a definite number you might want to say words like ‘several’ or ‘many’.

### Supporting sentences
This is the meat of the paragraph, and it provides all the necessary detail to support the idea expressed in the topic sentence. These will include evidence, explanation, or examples. They may involve facts, figures, or other particular details. They may tell a story, connect ideas, or express degrees of importance.

### Concluding sentence
In this final sentence, you need to restate the main idea without repeating any part of the paragraph. You will want to allude to or reference ideas from the supporting sentences, while paraphrasing your topic sentence.
