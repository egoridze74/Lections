Social networks have become a big part of our life in the last couple of years. They help people to communicate with each other and to receive the latest news or to learn something new. Despite this, social networks are a double-edged sword and this essay will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of them.

In the modern world everyone wants to be in touch with friends, family, colleagues, etc. If there were not any social networks, we would have to phone our friends one-by-one to find out what happened in their lives. It is also easier to attract attention of strangers to your product, action or something else with social networks if you are a businessman or a creative person. Moreover, some social networks have become a place where people meet and unite in the interest groups. All this shows us that social networks made information exchange between people quicker and more comfortable.

Unfortunately, sometimes good things bring bad consequences. Social networks make people more sensitive to anxiety, stress and anger because quickly updating information affects hormones in our brain. For some people social networks have become more than a way of communication, so they spend way too much time watching other people. Overall, behavior and habits of the new generation truly were changed by the social networks.

The advantages and the disadvantages of social networks are discussed in this essay only partly but even so we can say that this trend of the new generation brought to our life both good and bad.
