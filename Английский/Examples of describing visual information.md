## **Graph**

**The graph** presents the monthly attendance rates experienced by the Shanghai Library in **2010**. The overall trend of the data depicts a somewhat **steady increase**; however, minor downward **deviations** occur at two points in the year.

Following **the year’s** start of 35,000 library visitors in January, a clear drop in attendance rates can be seen, with **the data** showing its **most major trough** in February at about 28,000. But attendance rebounds in March to approximately 39,000 and climbs steadily by about 5000 people over the next three months to its first peak of 44,000 in June. Then attendance drops again to the year’s **second trough** of 37,000 in July before starting a four-month climb to 45,000 in November. This month marks the second and highest peak depicted in the chart. December finishes just slightly weaker than the previous month at 44,000. The year-end figure marks a **9,000-person increase on January**.

## **Table**

The table gives information on the underground railway systems in terms of the routes covered, passengers travelling annually, and the year the railway system was initiated in six cities across the globe.

**Overall**, it is clear that two of the oldest systems are London and Paris, but Paris and Tokyo have a large number of passengers travelling annually. **Meanwhile**, London has the largest route travelled.

**As per the table**, the oldest underground railway service provider is in London, opened in 1863 and it also covers the longest rail route of 394 km. Paris comes in second – the Paris metro was inaugurated in 1900. In terms of the size of the railway systems, London is nearly twice the size of Paris but the congestion in terms of travellers is more at the latter which is in second place with 1,191 million passengers yearly. Interestingly, Tokyo, which has only 155 kilometres of train tracks, serves the greatest number of passengers per year, at 1,927 million commuters.

These metro systems are then followed by the opening of the railway systems in Washington DC, Kyoto and Los Angeles. The latest built station is in Los Angeles which started to operate in 2001 and covers a significantly smaller railway route than the others at mere 28 km. Kyoto, which was built two decades before the Los Angeles station, has the smallest system comprising of only 11 kilometres. Kyoto and Los Angeles both serve the smallest number of passengers per year with 45 and 50 million respectively.

## **Bar chart**

1. **The bar chart shows** the percentages of city and rural households with Internet access in a European country from 1999 to 2004. **Generally speaking**, fewer percentages of rural households had the Internet connection than that of city people and overall Internet accessibility has been enhanced remarkably over the time.

	In 1999, merely 2% of rural households in this European country had access to the Internet while around 15% of city dwellers had this facility. Next year, one out of every 20 rural houses gained Internet access while almost one-third of urban and suburban families were connected to the global network. After two years, half of the city dwellers gained Internet access while it was as small as 15% for rural citizens. Within the next two years, the percentages of households in rural areas who joined this network increased sharply, from 15% to 35%. The ratio of households in urban and suburban areas with Internet access rose to roughly 55%, a slower extension than that of rural households during the last three years. The ratio of homes, both in cities and rural areas, with access to the Internet was quite minuscule in 1999 but improved dramatically within the next 5 years.
2. **The bar chart gives** the percentage of passenger cars manufactured by different regions of the world. **For the purpose of this data set**, the world is divided into seven regions, with the total adding up to 100%. 
	**What stands out** is that the regions of Greater China and Europe lead the way **In terms of** the manufacture of passenger cars, with 26% and 25% **respectively** . **By contrast** , very few cars are produced in the Middle East and Africa: just 2% originate from that area. 

	**Turning next to** the Americas, a sharp contrast can be seen between the Northern and Southern parts of the continent. **Whereas** North America can boast 19% of the world’s passenger car production, South America manufactures just 4% of this type of vehicle. 

	**Finally, moving on to** Japan and Korea, **although** they are just two countries rather than a whole region, they account for a sizeable proportion of the total, at 16%.


## **Pie chart**

**The two pie charts depict** the percentage of the money spent on different goods and services of any nation in 1950 and 2010. **Overall**, it is clear that the spending pattern changed almost completely over the given time frame. Housing was the biggest investment sector in 1950, however people spent most of their money on food in 2010.

In 2010, the largest proportion of expenditure (34%) was on food whereas in 1950 this value was just 11.2%. **There was a great difference in terms of** the amount of money people spent on housing between the two years. In 1950, 72.1% of the total household budget went towards housing, compared to only 22% in 2010. It is interesting to note that funds allocated for education were roughly the same in the given years. Moreover, health care was the sector which got the least share over the period in question.

Analysing further, people had notably increased the amount of money spent on transportation between the two dates in which 14% of the total budget was disbursed in the later year comparing to only 3.3% in the former year. In addition, the charts show a significant rise in the proportion of money spent on health care in 2010 compared to 1950.

## **Bar and Pie charts**
The bar chart and pie charts illustrate the percentage of people in Glasgow having three levels of education (university, school and those with no qualifications) in 2010. Information is divided into five age groups in the bar chart and by gender in the pie charts. 

Overall, the majority of people with university education were in the younger age groups, while in the oldest age group most people did not have any qualifications. The proportions of men and women were similar and showed little difference between the levels of education. 

The percentage of people with university education was up to 76% in the younger three age groups compared to only 50% in those aged 50 to 75 and just 25% in those over 75. This trend was reversed in those with no qualifications (9% in younger people rising to 72% in the oldest age group). The figure for those with school education was relatively constant at around 20% but was as low as 3% in the over 75’s. 

The proportion of men and women in each level of education was around one third with only a slight difference of 3% in university graduates as well as those who did not have educational qualifications.
