## Relative clauses
1) **Short prepositions** (e.g. with, about) usually come in the middle or at the end of relative clauses, but they can also come before which/whom, especially in formal English. 
- Informal: This is the scam (that/which) I warned you **about** last week.
- Formal: This is the scam **about which** I warned you last week.

2) **Longer prepositions** (e.g. according to, in spite of) or prepositions with modifiers (e.g. several weeks after, four metres above) come before which/whom. 
	- We spoke to a financial advisor, according **to whom** was all above board.
	- **Not:** who it was all above board according to. 
	- I paid a lot of money for the software, **shortly after which** I realised it was only a one-month subscription.

3) We can add a number or quantifier (e.g. three, several) of before which/whom. 
	- I bought ten cameras online, five/half **of which** never arrived.

4) There are a few fixed expressions with preposition + which + noun that can introduce a relative clause.
	- We arrived at ten, **by which time** all the food was gone.
	- I saw that my account was empty, **at which point** I realised I'd been taken in.
